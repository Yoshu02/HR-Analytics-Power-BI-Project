# HR-Analytics-Power-BI-Project
Objective:

To create an interactive Power BI dashboard for analyzing employee attendance patterns, identifying trends, and generating actionable insights for HR and organizational decision-making.

Key Features:

1. Data Consolidation:

Combined attendance data from multiple Excel sheets with varying structures into a unified format.
Automated transformations using Power BI's Power Query and DAX functions to ensure future scalability.

2. Interactive Metrics:

Presence percentage: The proportion of employees present on any given day or month.
Work-from-home percentage: The ratio of work-from-home days to total present days.
Sick leave percentage: The percentage of sick leave days relative to total working days.

3. Dynamic Filters and Slicers:

Filters for months, specific employees, and day-of-the-week analysis.
Slicers for interactive exploration of trends and insights.

4. Trends and Patterns:

Identified attendance trends, such as declining presence over months or popular work-from-home days (e.g., Fridays).
Trendlines added for better visualization of attendance and work-from-home behavior over time.

5. Day-Specific Insights:

Attendance behavior analysis by the day of the week to support team-building and planning activities.
Insights on optimal days for in-office meetings and events based on employee presence.

6. Automation and Alerts:

Notifications set up for scenarios like attendance dropping below a defined threshold.
Configured for integration with cloud platforms (e.g., SharePoint, Google Sheets) for real-time data updates.

7. Scalability and Security:

Designed for scalability with reusable data transformations and dynamic dashboards.
Implemented row-level security to ensure data access restrictions based on roles (e.g., managers vs. employees).

8. Enhanced Usability:

User-friendly visualizations including line charts, bar charts, and tables for quick comprehension.
Drill-down capabilities for detailed individual attendance records.

9. Impact:

*Improved HR decision-making with data-driven insights into employee attendance patterns.
*Optimized planning for hybrid work models, office capacity, and team activities.
*Enhanced productivity by automating manual reporting and enabling real-time updates.
*Cost-saving opportunities through better resource and space utilization.

10. Tools and Technologies Used:

*Power BI Desktop
*Power Query for data transformation
*DAX for creating dynamic measures and calculations
*Microsoft Excel for initial data storage

Outcome:

A professional-grade dashboard that streamlines attendance analysis, supports strategic HR initiatives, and provides actionable insights for organizational efficiency.

This project is a valuable addition to any portfolio for demonstrating skills in data analytics, dashboarding, and problem-solving in real-world business scenarios.
